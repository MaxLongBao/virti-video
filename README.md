Render the video found in the public folder on the page. Make it as pretty (or as ugly) as you like. In the public/images folder you will find three images that should render in the following ways during the video playing. Timings are in reference to the current time of the video. Using a native html5 video component is preferred. You can also migrate this to use typescript if you'd prefer.

Feel free to ask any questions, as well as to have fun and expand on the specification as much as you like (e.g. custom controls, fullscreen toggle button, a button that runs away from your cursor).
